Week: **[INSERT WEEK NUM HERE]**


## Code

The main topic this week was: **Encoder**

Commands: **resetEncoders() and getMeters()**

Subsystems: **Drivetrain**

### How does the code work?
We use functions to get how many ticks we have travelled. We then convert this to meters. We also created some objects for the gyroscope and created functions to reset them, read their values, etc.


### Important notes for future reference
Notes about git, and helpful resources, etc.
